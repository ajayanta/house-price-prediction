# House Price Prediction App

This is a machine learning-based web application that predicts house prices in Bengaluru, India. The project uses real-world housing data from Kaggle and walks through the full pipeline: data preprocessing, model training, serialization, and deployment using Streamlit.

## Features

- Uses Bengaluru House Price dataset from Kaggle
- Performs data cleaning, feature engineering, and model training
- Saves the trained model using pickle for reuse
- Provides an interactive Streamlit web application for predictions
- Simple interface to input property features like location, area, BHK, and bathrooms

# House Price Prediction App
